# AR Machine Harness Analysis

This project is our Software Engineering Group Project during my exchange at University of Nottingham UK.

This project attempts to tackle the ever growing problem of identifying electrical components responsible for faults on modern machinery for JCB.

The application will overlay the electrical harness of machines on top of a image target. This harness will then have relevant components to the fault code visible and allow for arrows to be toggles to further highlight each individual component. Furthermore the application will make key information available on how to identify a component as fault and resolve the fault.
